# STISIM-Data-Cleaner
A windows application that clears all the meta-data out of a STISIM driving simulator log file, saving the raw, collected data in a new file, preserving the file name structure.

Simply run the .exe in STISIM Data cleaner\STISIM Data cleaner\bin\Release, navigate to the location where log files are saved, select an arbitrary log file, and the applet will go through the folder of that file, extracting the raw log data without the metadata saved by STISIM into a new file with the same name and a tag indicating its been cleaned from metadata.
